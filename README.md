# Git It Done!
## Description
This is a website utilizing the GitHub REST API to fetch repositories with open issues and pull requests to which you can contribute. This site can also be used to check the status of your own repositories. Simply enter a GitHub username in the search bar, and Git It Done will display that user's repositories and whether or not they have open issues. Only thirty repositories will be displayed at a time. Click on a repository to visit another page with each open issue for said repository. Alternatively, click on a language button to search for popular repositories with issues that use the language clicked.
